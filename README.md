# 👋 Hi, I'm Joseph Ashworth

## 💻 Junior Software Developer | Northcoders Graduate | JavaScript Enthusiast

I'm a former soldier turned software developer, combining discipline, resilience, and a love for tech to build clean, accessible, and functional web applications.

🎮 My journey into coding began with a passion for gaming and building PCs — which eventually led me to Northcoders, where I trained as a full-stack JavaScript developer.
